The client was in the process of building a large [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) app and found that their views were being loaded rather slowly. To get around that, they were thinking about eager-loading all the templates at once after the first view had been rendered.

They asked me to investigate that that option. I accepted it as a challenge, not having any useful prior experience with AngularJS. I found a solution and, as requested, built a proof of concept. After that was done, I thought that might be of interest to others as well and packaged it for [bower](http://bower.io/).
