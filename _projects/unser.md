This was a mostly non-technical project together with [Axel Richter](http://axel-richter.eu). It involved talking to projected business contacts and manufacturers in addition to co-designing the brand itself and the marketing materials.

Due to an admittedly bad initial strategy based on false assumption about the market, we had to mothball this for the time being. We are in the process of regrouping and anticipate tackling this with a different approach. For that we are in contact with people who have done this kind of thing successfully and are incorporating their input into our deliberations.
