Back in 2010 I built a little web site for a local Karate Club. It needed to be simple to use and I wanted it to be beautiful. It was supposed to inform about the dojo, present the members, show some images, and give some details about the Karate style practiced there.

I decided that those requirements would best be met by a mid-level CMS and chose [radiantCMS](http://radiantcms.org/), which I had some experience with. It's built with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and includes [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writing page content. That meant it would have been easy to add more functionality --in case I needed it-- and the less tech-savvy folks in the club management would be able to use with little instruction. It was adopted with a little more hassle than I'd hoped, but all in all that went well.

I hosted the site on my web space at [RailsPlayground.com](http://railsplayground.com/) because at that time they were a pretty good provider with good service quality even for low-level clients. Unfortunately, that changed later on and their service personnel became incompetent from one day to the next. As long as everything kept running, I was willing to accept that due to their low prices and the fact that good rails hosting was in its infancy. Of course, inevitably, the day came when it became unbearable, so in early 2014 I decommissioned that web space and set out to transfer the site.

I did not need any web space for myself and I did not have any ongoing commitment to the club, so I decided to off-load the hosting to the club's management. In keeping with my happy-client-policy, I decided to rebuild the site in a way that made it easily portable. Also, I wanted to use this  opportunity to give the site a tech overhaul so that it would be as [responsive](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh653584.aspx) as feasible without too much work. So, I pulled the whole site content into a single HTML file that would look good on any device.
