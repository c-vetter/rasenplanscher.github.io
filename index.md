title: Hello, World!

...that's how you start a journey in coding, [by convention](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hello+world&ia=about). So, that's how this here starts. If you are not a world, I still bid you welcome to this little project of mine: my blog/website -- my vanity card, if you will ;)

This is where I endeavor to write about my adventures in web coding. I've had some of that in the past and may write about that, but I'm mainly looking ahead with this.


## What is this about? ##
This is mainly about getting something out there to point at and say "I done that!" -- if someone else actually learns from this, so much the better!

## About me ##

So, who the heck is writing this here, anyway?! At this point, you're bound to know me for just about nothing because I've been working in agency environments most of the time -- which means I have little to show for what I've done.

In my career as a web developer/generalist, I've built websites, web shops, landing pages, responsive frontends, I've done image editing, 3D graphics pre-press and post-press work, workflow optimization, co-worker training, and whatever else was to be done.

## What now? ##
Click "[Blog](/blog.html)" and read a post or two :P

Also, go out and have fun!

Cordially
me =)
