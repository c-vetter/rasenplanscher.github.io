title: Projects Showroom added
---

Today I got to play with [Jekyll's collections feature](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). As planned, I setup a few pages for my projects and linked them through a [projects "showroom"](/projects.html). The whole thing was pretty straight-forward and I could just go by the documentation and get it setup the way I wanted.

In the process, I added some more styling and pulled in the mobile meta tags I was missing O_o I'm not totally happy with my project pages yet, but it's just too late to do anything about it...

I also added a `gh-pages` branch to my [angular-template-bundler](https://github.com/rasenplanscher/angular-template-bundler), showing the `README` file in a nice brown theme. I'd like to add some more eye-candy, but I don't have a great idea at this point, so I'll leave it as is, for now.
