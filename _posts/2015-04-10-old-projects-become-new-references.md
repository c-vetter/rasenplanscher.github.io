title: Old Projects become New References

Today was a slow day: I was very tired when I got up, but sleeping long just wasn't an option since I had to 'visit the authorities'. Yeah, so no rest for the wicked, as they say...

In that vein, I didn't drop back into bed when I returned but instead used the day as best I could. After taking care of inevitable communications --email and phone calls that were bound to happen anyway-- I went to work getting a few samples of my work onto GitHub pages:

* [my former karate club's first website](http://2010.kyokushin-mannheim.de.rasenplanscher.info)
* [the same club's second and current website](http://kyokushin-mannheim.de.rasenplanscher.info)
* [my first production-grade open source project](http://simple-transfer.rasenplanscher.info)

I would have liked to do something fancier but I really didn't have my wits about me and I thought better this than nothing! Tomorrow I'm going to get my latest project on here as well: [angular-template-bundler](https://github.com/rasenplanscher/angular-template-bundler). After that I want to setup a little show-room thing to point at those things from a "timeless" location, as opposed to these soon-to-be-obsolete posts.
