title: "Some visitor-interaction, please: welcoming Disqus to the party"

Just a quick update: I just added Disqus in order to allow for visitors to comment, should anybody desire to do so. It's a pity you can't really test it locally :\ but such inconvenience is the price I pay for their checking the domain (a.k.a. security), so that's ok. Other than that it just works, so I got nothing more to write :D
