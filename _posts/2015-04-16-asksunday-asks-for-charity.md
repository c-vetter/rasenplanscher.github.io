title: AskSunday asks for charity
---

Some time back, I tried and cancelled [AskSundy](http://asksundy.com) due to their dismal service. Today, they asked me for charity money again.

So first of all, what's the deal with AskSunday? It's a VPA service from India that does not deliver any service. When I contacted them, they were friendly and everything, quickly setup an account, and assigned me an assistant. In that time, of course, they graciously accepted my money and when the time came for my assistant to assist me, he promptly did nothing. That's right, he did not even produce bad output -- I literally got nothing except confirmations that he would get to work on his assigned tasks. Being busy myself, I did not have the time to babysit my assistant through his tasks, hence my desire for an assistant O_o

Naturally, I contacted my liaison officer/his superior, asking what was going on. He assured me to get onto the issue and make I got my results in time. After that he obviously really went to work -- doing exactly nothing. Recognizing a pattern, I basically told them to fuck off. I had no illusions about getting my money back and was just glad that I did not invest a lot in those bums.

So, today I got a call -- private number of course, they wouldn't wanna get blocked or anything -- telling me about an "exciting" promotional "offer": order the small package and get a few hours for free. Yeah, that sure is happening -- I'd really appreciate a few more hours and dollars wasted on a couple of Indian bums!

At the phone I told them I had cancelled due to severe problems last time -- having had my mind elsewhere, I wasn't immediately aware, what that had been -- and they promptly assured me that all of those had been resolved by now. Sure, no idea what had happened, but it must be fine now -- otherwise they wouldn't try to push their crap on me again, now would they?!

Starting the call, they kept the cost part on the down-low and just talked about giving me free hours, so I was inclined to listen, not recalling just yet the horrific experience of last time. But when I heard her tell me about how I could just go with the small package if I'm not entirely confident in their con-scheme right now, I told her I wouldn't pay them a single cent. She just hung up on me, no sorry, no good-bye. Now, that's customer service and sweet-talking in a major package right there!

In conclusion, anyone considering trying out their "service", do not pay them before they have delivered! That's my lesson for the future, for any such engagement. Anyone worth their salt should be confident enough in the quality of their service that they let you check it out for at least a week!
